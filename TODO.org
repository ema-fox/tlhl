* TODO Ensure all elements are represented.

  Check against: http://xhtml.com/en/xhtml/reference/

* TODO Implement the equivalent Mako bench marks

  Would be interesting to see how performance compares to some other
  libraries.

* TODO Add some more convenience elements

  Such as;

  - jslink, csslink for emiting links to resources without having to
    provide a dictionary

  - js, css which automagically wrap the content in CDATA sections,
    etc

* TODO Add a django contrib

  Elements to emit django forms and fields, etc.
